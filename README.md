## Abstract
Diarrhetic Shellfish Poisoning (DSP) is a global health threat arising from shellfish contaminated with toxins produced by dinoflagellates. The condition, with its widespread incidence, high morbidity rate, and persistent shellfish toxicity, poses risks to public health and the shellfish industry. Blooms of toxin-producing algae such as DSP are known as Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). Monitoring and forecasting systems are crucial for mitigating HABs impact. The study of phytoplankton blooms and their causes is challenging, prompting the exploration of advanced machine learning techniques. Predicting harmful algal blooms involves a time-series-based problem with a strong historical seasonal component, however, anomalies due to changes in meteorological and oceanographic events have been observed. Stream Learning stands out as one of the most promising approaches for addressing this category of issues. However, its efficacy in predicting HABs remains unproven and needs to be tested in comparison with Batch Learning. Historical data availability is a critical point in developing predictive systems. In oceanography, the data collection can have some constrains, which has led to exploring new tools to obtain more exhaustive time series. Ocean hydrodynamic models, such as CROCO, has proven its ability to reproduce the ocean conditions with a high time frequency. Model explainability is increasingly crucial for decision acceptance, particularly in the context of alarm systems like HAB forecasting. In this study, a machine learning workflow for predicting HABs causing DSP was developed with several key advancements. Seven machine learning algorithms were compared within two learning paradigms. Notably, the output data from CROCO, the ocean hydrodynamic model, was employed as the primary dataset, palliating the limitation of time-continuous historical data. The study highlights the value of models interpretability, fair models comparison methodology, and the incorporation of Stream Learning models. The model DoME, with an average $R^2$ of 0.77 in the 3-day-ahead prediction, emerged as the most effective and interpretable predictor, outperforming the other algorithms.
